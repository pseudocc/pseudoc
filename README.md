Coding...

Testing new ideas. No unit test at all.

## Code Style
- indent: 2 whitespaces
- naming:
  - lower cases with underscores
  - suffix `_t` for `typedef` types
  - prefix `r_` for pointer type in the parameter used as a c++ reference type
  - prefix `i` sometime might be represent the indirect pointer
- pointer type: `int*` * after the type without a whitespace
- brace: start with a whitespace but does not switch to new lines
- short statement: keep them two line with indent
- no implementations in header file
- use include guard instead of `#pragma once`
