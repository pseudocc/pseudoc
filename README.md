my programming language

## purpose and aims

for myself, main purpose is to learn a lot of things:
  - pure c project
    - gcc build
    - unit test
  - data structure
    - max heap
    - linked list
    - etc.
  - linux
    - open/close
    - brk/sbrk/mmap
  - memory management
    - disk <=> memory
    - arrange scratches

for this language:
  - allocate limited physical memory
  - define your own syntactic sugar
  - generic types

## about me

the most regretful thing in my life is that i did not work hard in colleague. 

and in my first 3 years of employment, i hardly developed my programming skills.
